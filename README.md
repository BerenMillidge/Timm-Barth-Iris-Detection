# Timm-Barth-Iris-Detection
An implementation of the iris detection algorithm in Timm and Barth 2011

Can be used to obtain likely iris centers from segmented eye images. Is robust to glasses, prominent eyebrows or fringes and works under many lighting conditions. Implementation based on the paper: http://www.inb.uni-luebeck.de/publikationen/pdfs/TiBa11b.pdf
